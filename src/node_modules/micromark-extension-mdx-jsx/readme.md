## What is this?

This package contains an extension that adds support for the JSX syntax enabled by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to [`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark). These extensions are used inside MDX. It mostly matches how JSX works in most places that support it (TypeScript, Babel, esbuild, SWC, etc).

This package can be made aware or unaware of JavaScript syntax. When unaware, expressions could include Rust or variables or whatnot.

## When to use this

This project is useful when you want to support JSX in markdown.

You can use this extension when you are working with [`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark). To support all MDX features, use [`micromark-extension-mdxjs`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdxjs) instead.

When you need a syntax tree, combine this package with [`mdast-util-mdx-jsx`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-mdx-jsx).

All these packages are used in [`remark-mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/), which focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting these internals away.

When you are using [`mdx-js/mdx`](https://mdxjs.com), all of this is already included.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install micromark-extension-mdx-jsx
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import {mdxJsx} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {mdxJsx} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-jsx@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {mdxJsx} from 'micromark-extension-mdx-jsx'

const output = micromark('a <b c d="e" /> f', {extensions: [mdxJsx()]})

console.log(output)
```

Yields:

```html
<p>a  f</p>
```

…which is useless: go to a syntax tree with [`mdast-util-from-markdown`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-from-markdown) and [`mdast-util-mdx-jsx`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-mdx-jsx) instead.

## API

This package exports the identifier [`mdxJsx`](./#mdxjsxoptions). There is no default export.

The export map supports the [`development` condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_resolving_user_conditions). Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code. Without this condition, production code is loaded.

### `mdxJsx(options?)`

Create an extension for `micromark` to enable MDX JSX syntax.

**Parameters**

* `options` ([`Options`](./#options), optional) — configuration

**Returns**

Extension for `micromark` that can be passed in `extensions` to enable MDX JSX syntax ([`Extension`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark#syntaxextension)).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

**Fields**

* `acorn` ([`Acorn`](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn), optional) — acorn parser to use
* `acornOptions` ([`AcornOptions`](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/96c721dbf89d0ccc3a8c7f39e69ef2a6a3c04dfa/acorn/dist/acorn.d.ts#L16), default: `{ecmaVersion: 2020, locations: true, sourceType: 'module'}`) — configuration for acorn; all fields except `locations` can be set
* `addResult` (`boolean`, default: `false`) — whether to add `estree` fields to tokens with results from acorn

## Authoring

When authoring markdown with JSX, keep in mind that MDX is a whitespace sensitive and line-based language, while JavaScript is insensitive to whitespace. This affects how markdown and JSX interleave with eachother in MDX. For more info on how it works, see [§ Interleaving](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#interleaving) on the MDX site.

**Comments inside tags**

JavaScript comments in JSX are not supported.

Incorrect:

```jsx
<hi/*comment!*//>
<hello// comment!
/>
```

Correct:

```jsx
<hi/>
<hello
/>
```

A PR that adds support for them would be accepted.

**Element or fragment attribute values**

JSX elements or JSX fragments as attribute values are not supported. The reason for this change is that it would be confusing whether markdown would work.

Incorrect:

```jsx
<welcome name=<>Venus</> />
<welcome name=<span>Pluto</span> />
```

Correct:

```jsx
<welcome name='Mars' />
<welcome name={<span>Jupiter</span>} />
```

**Greater than (`>`) and right curly brace (`}`)**

JSX does not allow U+003E GREATER THAN (`>`) or U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACE (`}`) literally in text, they need to be encoded as character references (or expressions). There is no good reason for this (some JSX parsers agree with us and don’t crash either). Therefore, in MDX, U+003E GREATER THAN (`>`) and U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACE (`}`) are fine literally and don’t need to be encoded.

## Syntax

JSX forms with the following BNF:

```
 ::=  * [ *]
 ::= 

; constraint: markdown whitespace (` | `) is NOT
; allowed directly after `<` in order to allow `1 < 3` in markdown.
 ::=
  '<' []
  [*  [] []]
  * '>'

 ::=
  1* ( | ) |
  *  |
 ::=
  * ( |  | )
 ::=  []
; Note: in gnostic mode the value of the expression must instead be a single valid ES spread
; expression
 ::=  []
 ::=   []

 ::= * '/'

 ::=  [ | ]
 ::=  []
 ::= * ':' * 
 ::=  *
 ::= * '.' * 

 ::=  *
 ::= * '=' * 
 ::=  |  | 
; Note: in gnostic mode the value must instead be a single valid ES expression
 ::= '{' *( | ) '}'

 ::= '"' * '"'
 ::= "'" * "'"

 ::= 
 ::= char - '"'
 ::= char - "'"
 ::= char - '{' - '}'
 ::= 
 ::=  | '-'

 ::= '\t' | ' '
 ::= '\n' | '\r' | '\r\n'

; ECMAScript
; See “IdentifierStart”: <>
 ::= ?
; See “IdentifierPart”: <>
 ::= ?
; See “Whitespace”: <>
 ::= ?
```

As the flow construct occurs in flow, like all flow constructs, it must be followed by an eol (line ending) or eof (end of file).

The grammar for JSX in markdown is much stricter than that of HTML in markdown. The primary benefit of this is that tags are parsed into tokens, and thus can be processed. Another, arguable, benefit of this is that it comes with syntax errors: if an author types something that is nonsensical, an error is thrown with information about where it happened, what occurred, and what was expected instead.

This extension supports expressions both aware and unaware to JavaScript (respectively gnostic and agnostic). Depending on whether acorn is passed, either valid JavaScript must be used in expressions, or arbitrary text (such as Rust code or so) can be used.

More on this can be found in [§ Syntax of `micromark-extension-mdx-expression`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-expression/blob/main/packages/micromark-extension-mdx-expression/readme.md#syntax).

## Errors

In aware (gnostic) mode, expressions are parsed with [`micromark-extension-mdx-expression`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdx-expression), which throws some more errors.

### Unexpected end of file $at, expected $expect

This error occurs for many different reasons if something was opened but not closed (source: `micromark-extension-mdx-jsx`, rule id: `unexpected-eof`).

Some examples are:

```markdown
<
</
<a
<a:
<a.
<a b
<a b:
<a b=
<a b="
<a b='
<a b={
<a/
```

### Unexpected character $at, expected $expect

This error occurs for many different reasons if an unexpected character is seen (source: `micromark-extension-mdx-jsx`, rule id: `unexpected-character`).

Some examples are:

```markdown
<.>
</.>
<a?>
<a:+>
<a./>
<a b!>
<a b:1>
<a b=>
<a/->
```
