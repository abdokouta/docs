## What is this?

This package is a [unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) ([remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)) plugin that switches from remark (the markdown ecosystem) to rehype (the HTML ecosystem). It does this by transforming the current markdown (mdast) syntax tree into an HTML (hast) syntax tree. remark plugins deal with mdast and rehype plugins deal with hast, so plugins used after `remark-rehype` have to be rehype plugins.

The reason that there are different ecosystems for markdown and HTML is that turning markdown into HTML is, while frequently needed, not the only purpose of markdown. Checking (linting) and formatting markdown are also common use cases for remark and markdown. There are several aspects of markdown that do not translate 1-to-1 to HTML. In some cases markdown contains more information than HTML: for example, there are several ways to add a link in markdown (as in, autolinks: `<https://url>`, resource links: `[label](url)`, and reference links with definitions: `[label][id]` and `[id]: url`). In other cases HTML contains more information than markdown: there are many tags, which add new meaning (semantics), available in HTML that aren’t available in markdown. If there was just one AST, it would be quite hard to perform the tasks that several remark and rehype plugins currently do.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees (ASTs). **remark** adds support for markdown to unified. **rehype** adds support for HTML to unified. **mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses. **hast** is the markdown AST that rehype uses. This is a remark plugin that transforms mdast into hast to support rehype.

## When should I use this?

This project is useful when you want to turn markdown to HTML. It opens up a whole new ecosystem with tons of plugins to do all kinds of things. You can [minify HTML](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify), [format HTML](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-format), [make sure it’s safe](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize), [highlight code](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight), [add metadata](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-meta), and a lot more.

A different plugin, [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw), adds support for raw HTML written inside markdown. This is a separate plugin because supporting HTML inside markdown is a heavy task and not always needed. To use both together, you also have to configure `remark-rehype` with `allowDangerousHtml: true`.

The rehype plugin [`rehype-remark`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-remark) does the inverse of this plugin. It turns HTML into markdown.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install remark-rehype
```

In Deno with [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev):

```js
import remarkRehype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-rehype@10?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev):

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkRehype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-rehype@10?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.md`:

```markdown
# Hello world

> Block quote.

Some _emphasis_, **importance**, and `code`.
```

And our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypeDocument)
    .use(rehypeFormat)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Now, running `node example.js` yields:

```txt
example.md: no issues found
```

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>example</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Block quote.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Some <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>importance</strong>, and <code>code</code>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API

This package exports `defaultHandlers`, `all`, and `one`. The default export is `remarkRehype`.

### `unified().use(remarkRehype[, destination][, options])`

Plugin that turns markdown into HTML to support rehype.

**`destination`**

If a [`Unified`](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processor) destination processor is given, that processor runs with a new HTML (hast) tree (bridge-mode). As the given processor runs with a hast tree, and rehype plugins support hast, that means rehype plugins can be used with the given processor. The hast tree is discarded in the end.

> 👉 **Note**: It’s highly unlikely that you want to do this.

**`options`**

Configuration (optional).

**`options.allowDangerousHtml`**

Whether to persist raw HTML in markdown in the hast tree (`boolean`, default: `false`). Raw HTML is available in the markdown (mdast) tree as [`html`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#html) nodes and can be embedded in the HTML (hast) tree as semistandard `raw` nodes. Most rehype plugins ignore `raw` nodes, but two notable plugins don’t:

* [`rehype-stringify`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/tree/main/packages/rehype-stringify) also has an option `allowDangerousHtml` which will output the raw HTML. This is typically discouraged as noted by the option name but is useful if you completely trust who authors the markdown
* [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw) can handle the raw embedded HTML strings in hast trees by parsing them into standard hast nodes (element, text, etc). This is a heavy task as it needs a full HTML parser, but it is the only way to support untrusted content

**`options.clobberPrefix`**

Prefix to use before the `id` attribute on footnotes to prevent it from _clobbering_ (`string`, default: `'user-content-'`). DOM clobbering is this:

```html
<p id=x></p>
<script>alert(x) // `x` now refers to the DOM `p#x` element</script>
```

Elements by their ID are made available by browsers on the `window` object, which is a security risk. Using a prefix solves this problem.

> 👉 **Note**: this option affects footnotes. Footnotes are not specified by CommonMark so they’re not supported in remark by default. They are supported by GitHub, so they can be enabled by using the remark plugin [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).

**`options.footnoteLabel`**

Label to use for the footnotes section (`string`, default: `'Footnotes'`). Affects screen readers. Change it when the markdown is not in English.

**`options.footnoteBackLabel`**

Label to use from backreferences back to their footnote call (`string`, default: `'Back to content'`). Affects screen readers. Change it when the markdown is not in English.

**`options.handlers`**

This option is a bit advanced as it requires knowledge of ASTs, so we defer to the documentation available in [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast).

**`options.passThrough`**

This option is a bit advanced as it requires knowledge of ASTs, so we defer to the documentation available in [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast).

**`options.unknownHandler`**

This option is a bit advanced as it requires knowledge of ASTs, so we defer to the documentation available in [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast).

### `defaultHandlers`

The `defaultHandlers` export from [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast), useful when passing in your own handlers.

### `all`

The `all` export from [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast), useful when passing in your own handlers.

### `one`

The `one` export from [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast), useful when passing in your own handlers.

## Examples

### Example: supporting HTML in markdown naïvely

If you completely trust the authors of the input markdown and want to allow them to write HTML inside markdown, you can pass `allowDangerousHtml` to this plugin (`remark-rehype`) and `rehype-stringify`:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype, {allowDangerousHtml: true})
    .use(rehypeStringify, {allowDangerousHtml: true})
    .process('It <i>works</i>! <img onerror="alert(1)">')

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Running that code yields:

```html
<p>It <i>works</i>! <img onerror="alert(1)"></p>
```

> ⚠️ **Danger**: Observe that the XSS attack through the `onerror` attribute is still present.

### Example: supporting HTML in markdown properly

If you do not trust the authors of the input markdown, or if you want to make sure that rehype plugins can see HTML embedded in markdown, use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw). The following example passes `allowDangerousHtml` to this plugin (`remark-rehype`), then turns the raw embedded HTML into proper HTML nodes (`rehype-raw`), and finally sanitizes the HTML by only allowing safe things (`rehype-sanitize`):

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'
import rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype, {allowDangerousHtml: true})
    .use(rehypeRaw)
    .use(rehypeSanitize)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process('It <i>works</i>! <img onerror="alert(1)">')

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Running that code yields:

```html
<p>It <i>works</i>! <img></p>
```

> 👉 **Note**: Observe that the XSS attack through the `onerror` attribute is no longer present.

### Example: footnotes in languages other than English

If you know that the markdown is authored in a language other than English, and you’re using `remark-gfm` to match how GitHub renders markdown, and you know that footnotes are (or can?) be used, you should translate the labels associated with them.

Let’s first set the stage:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkGfm)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process('Hallo[^1]\n\n[^1]: Wereld!')

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Running that code yields:

```html
<p>Hallo<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<section data-footnotes class="footnotes"><h2 id="footnote-label" class="sr-only">Footnotes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="user-content-fn-1">
<p>Wereld! <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
```

This is a mix of English and Dutch that screen readers can’t handle nicely. Let’s say our program does know that the markdown is in Dutch. In that case, it’s important to translate and define the labels relating to footnotes so that screen reader users can properly pronounce the page:

```diff

```

Running the code with the above patch applied, yields:

```diff

 </ol>
 </section>
```

## Syntax tree

A frequent problem arises when having to turn one syntax tree into another. As the original tree (in this case, mdast for markdown) is in some cases limited compared to the destination (in this case, hast for HTML) tree, is it possible to provide more info in the original to define what the result will be in the destination? This is possible by defining data on mdast nodes, which this plugin will read as instructions on what hast nodes to create.

An example is `remark-math`, which defines semistandard math nodes that this plugin doesn’t understand. To solve this, `remark-math` defines instructions on mdast nodes that this plugin does understand because they define a certain hast structure.

As these instructions are somewhat advanced in that they requires knowledge of ASTs, we defer to the documentation available in the low level utility we use: [`mdast-util-to-hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-hast).

## CSS

Assuming you know how to use (semantic) HTML and CSS, then it should generally be straight forward to style the HTML produced by this plugin. With CSS, you can get creative and style the results as you please.

Some semistandard features, notably [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)s tasklists and footnotes, generate HTML that be unintuitive, as it matches exactly what GitHub produces for their website. There is a project, [`sindresorhus/github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), that exposes the stylesheet that GitHub uses for rendered markdown, which might either be inspirational for more complex features, or can be used as-is to exactly match how GitHub styles rendered markdown.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It exports `Options` and `Processor` types, which specify the interfaces of the accepted options.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+. Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `unified` version 6+, `remark-parse` version 3+ (used in `remark` version 7), and `rehype-stringify` version 3+ (used in `rehype` version 5).

## Security

Use of `remark-rehype` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack. Embedded [**hast**](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) properties (`hName`, `hProperties`, `hChildren`) in [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast), custom handlers, and the `allowDangerousHtml` option all provide openings. Use [`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize) to make the tree safe.
