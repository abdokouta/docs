# section-matter

> Like front-matter, but supports multiple sections in a document.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save section-matter
```

## Usage

**Params**

* `input` **{String|Buffer|Object}**: If input is an object, it's `content` property must be a string or buffer.
* **{Object}**: options
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an object with a `content` string and an array of `sections` objects.

**Example**

```js
var sections = require('{% raw %}
{%= name %}
{% endraw %}');
var result = sections(input, options);
// { content: 'Content before sections', sections: [] }
```

See available [options](./#options).

## Example

_With the exception of front-matter, **which must be the very first thing in the string**, the opening delimiter of all other sections must be followed by a string to be used as the `key` for the section._

Given the following string:

```
Content before the sections.

---

More content.

---one
title: One
---

This is the first section.
```

The following code:

```js
console.log(sections(input));
```

Results in:

```js
{ 
  content: 'Content before the sections.\n\n---\n\nMore content.\n',
  sections: [
    { 
      key: 'one',
      data: 'title: One',
      content: '\nThis is the first section.' 
    } 
  ] 
}
```

## Options

### options.section\_parse

**Type**: `function`

**Default**: `undefined`

Function to be called on each section after it's parsed from the string.

**Example**

Given the following string (`foo.md`):

```
This is content before the sections.

---one
title: First section
---

This is section one.

---two
title: Second section
---

This is section two.
```

Using the following custom `section_parse` function:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var yaml = require('js-yaml');
var sections = require('section-matter');

var str = fs.readFileSync('foo.md');
var options = {
  section_parse: function(section) {
    console.log(section)
    section.key = 'section-' + section.key;
    section.data = yaml.safeLoad(section.data);
  }
};

var result = sections(str, options);
console.log(result);
```

Results in:

```js
{
  content: 'This is content before the sections.\n',
  sections: [
    {
      key: 'section-one',
      data: { title: 'First section' },
      content: '\nThis is section one.\n'
    },
    {
      key: 'section-two',
      data: { title: 'Second section' },
      content: '\nThis is section two.\n'
    }
  ]
}
```

### options.section\_delimiter

**Type**: `string`

**Default**: `---`

Delimiter to use as the separator for sections. _With the exception of front-matter, which must be the very first thing in the string, the opening delimiter of all other sections must be followed by a string to be used as the `key` for the section._

**Example**

```js
var input = '~~~\ntitle: bar\n~~~\n\nfoo\n~~~one\ntitle: One\n~~~\nThis is one';
console.log(sections(input, {section_delimiter: '~~~'}));
```

Results in:

```js
{
  content: '',
  sections: [
    {
      key: '',
      data: 'title: bar',
      content: '\nfoo'
    },
    {
      key: 'one',
      data: 'title: One',
      content: 'This is one'
    }
  ]
}
```
