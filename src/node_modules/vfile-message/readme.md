## What is this?

This package provides a (lint) message format.

## When should I use this?

In most cases, you can use `file.message` from `VFile` itself, but in some cases you might not have a file, and still want to emit warnings or errors, in which case this can be used directly.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install vfile-message
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import {VFileMessage} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-message@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {VFileMessage} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-message@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {VFileMessage} from 'vfile-message'

const message = new VFileMessage(
  'Unexpected unknown word `braavo`, did you mean `bravo`?',
  {line: 1, column: 8},
  'spell:typo'
)

console.log(message)
```

Yields:

```txt
[1:8: Unexpected unknown word `braavo`, did you mean `bravo`?] {
  reason: 'Unexpected unknown word `braavo`, did you mean `bravo`?',
  line: 1,
  column: 8,
  source: 'spell',
  ruleId: 'typo',
  position: {start: {line: 1, column: 8}, end: {line: null, column: null}}
}
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`VFileMessage`](./#vfilemessagereason-place-origin). There is no default export.

### `VFileMessage(reason[, place][, origin])`

Create a message for `reason` at `place` from `origin`.

When an error is passed in as `reason`, the `stack` is copied.

**Parameters**

* `reason` (`string` or `Error`) — reason for message, uses the stack and message of the error if given
* `place` ([`Node`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#node), [`Position`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#position), or [`Point`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#point), optional) — place in file where the message occurred
* `origin` (`string`, optional) — place in code where the message originates (example: `'my-package:my-rule'` or `'my-rule'`)

**Extends**

[`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).

**Returns**

Instance of `VFileMessage`.

**Fields**

* `reason` (`string`) — reason for message (you should use markdown)
* `fatal` (`boolean | null | undefined`) — state of problem; `true` marks associated file as no longer processable (error); `false` necessitates a (potential) change (warning); `null | undefined` for things that might not need changing (info)
* `line` (`number | null`) — starting line of error
* `column` (`number | null`) — starting column of error
* `position` ([`Position | null`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#position)) — full unist position
* `source` (`string | null`, example: `'my-package'`) — namespace of message
* `ruleId` (`string | null`, example: `'my-rule'`) — category of message
* `stack` (`string | null`) — stack of message in code
* `file` (`string | null`) — path of a file (used throughout the `VFile` ecosystem)

### Well-known

It’s OK to store custom data directly on the `VFileMessage`, some of those are handled by [utilities](https://github.com/vfile/vfile#utilities). The following fields are documented and typed here.

**Fields**

* `actual` (`string | null`) — specify the source value that’s being reported, which is deemed incorrect
* `expected` (`Array<string> | null`) — suggest acceptable values that can be used instead of `actual`
* `url` (`string | null`) — link to docs for the message (this must be an absolute URL that can be passed as `x` to `new URL(x)`)
* `note` (`string | null`) — long form description of the message (you should use markdown)

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+. Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
