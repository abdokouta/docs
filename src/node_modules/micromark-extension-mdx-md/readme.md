## What is this?

This package contains an extension to turn off some markdown constructs when parsing.

## When to use this

This project is useful when you want to disable support for code (indented), autolinks, and HTML (flow and text) in markdown.

You can use this extension when you are working with [`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark). To support all MDX features, use [`micromark-extension-mdxjs`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-mdxjs) instead.

All these packages are used in [`remark-mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/remark-mdx/), which focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting these internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install micromark-extension-mdx-md
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```js
import {mdxMd} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-md@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {mdxMd} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-extension-mdx-md@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {mdxMd} from 'micromark-extension-mdx-md'

const output = micromark('\ta', {extensions: [mdxMd]})

console.log(output)
```

Yields:

```html
<p>a</p>
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`mdxMd`](./#mdxmd). There is no default export.

### `mdxMd`

Extension for `micromark` that can be passed in `extensions` to disable some CommonMark syntax (code (indented), autolinks, and HTML (flow and text)) for MDX ([`Extension`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark#syntaxextension)).

## Authoring

To improve authoring the new constructs MDX adds (JSX, expressions, and ESM), some markdown features are turned off by this extension. There are good alternatives.

**Code (indented)**

Use fenced code instead. Change the following markdown:

```markdown
    console.log(1)
```

…into:

````markdown
```js
console.log(1)
```
````

**Autolinks**

Use links (with a resource or a reference) instead. Change the following markdown:

```markdown
<https://some-link-here.com>
```

…into:

```markdown
[descriptive text](https://and-the-link-here.com)
```

**HTML (flow and text)**

Use JSX instead: change `<img>` into `<img />`. Not supporting HTML also means that HTML comments are not supported. Use a comment in an empty expression instead. Change `<!-- comment -->` into `{/* comment */}`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. As of now, that is Node.js 16+. Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

These extensions work with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
