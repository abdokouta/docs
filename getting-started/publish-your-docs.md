### Installing Maginium

Maginium uses Composer to manage dependencies. If you don't have Composer installed,
[download and install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

#### Step 1: Create a New Project

To start a new Maginium project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project maginium/framework my-project
```

This will create a new folder named `my-project` containing all the necessary files for Maginium.

---

#### Step 2: Configure Environment

Once the installation is complete, navigate to your project directory and set up the environment file:

```bash
cd my-project
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure your database and other environment-specific settings:

```plaintext
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

> **Tip:**\
> Use a strong database password to enhance security.

---

#### Step 3: Generate Application Key

Maginium requires an application key for secure encryption. Generate it using the following command:

```bash
php maginium key:generate
```

{% hint style="info" %} This command sets a unique `APP_KEY` in your `.env` file. Ensure this key remains secret. {% endhint %}

---

#### Step 4: Serve Your Application

You can serve your application locally using the built-in development server:

```bash
php maginium serve
```

By default, your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Access your application at `http://localhost`.

{% hint style="info" %} Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system before using this method. {% endhint %}
